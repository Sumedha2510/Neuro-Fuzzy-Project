# V-Care


V-Care project deals with the detection and prediction of diseases such as brain tumor,retinal fundus(all 39 types), parkinson's disease.
To improve the diagnostic process, the implementation of artificial intelligence in the medical field is a most exciting step. Artificial intelligence makes the screening, diagnosis and medical treatment of cancer and other inheritance diseases easier. Artificial intelligence also serves the patients by providing symptoms checker facilities.


## Fields of Focus


### 1. Parkinson's Disease

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. A disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement, often including tremors. Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's.

### 2. Brain Tumor

A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in your brain. Many different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). Brain tumors can begin in your brain (primary brain tumors), or cancer can begin in other parts of your body and spread to your brain as secondary (metastatic) brain tumors. Our model helps in detecting glioma,meningioma and pituitary tumors


### 3. Retinal Fundus Diseases

It is the interior lining of the eyeball, including the retina (the light-sensitive screen), optic disc (the head of the nerve to the eye), and the macula (the small spot in the retina where vision is keenest). Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, retinal fundus diseases can cause irreversible vision loss.
